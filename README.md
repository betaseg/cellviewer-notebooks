# Protocol Notebooks 

This repository contains the code that accompanies the protocol paper

*Organelle-specific segmentation, spatial analysis and visualization of volume electron microscopy datasets* 

The following subfolders contain code that augment described protocol steps: 


1. [`plots`](./plots)
    
    Notebooks relating to the generation of organelle interaction plots

2. [`unet`](./unet)
   
    Training and prediction notebooks for a 3D U-Net model for segmentation of golgi aparatus from FIB-SEM volumes

3. [`stardist`](./stardist/)

    Training and prediction notebooks for a 3D U-Net stardist model for segmentation of secretory granules from FIB-SEM volumes
